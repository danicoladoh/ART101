                    Hi, I'm Lila and welcome to my garden! Can you look over there? 
                    I live in that fig tree. Did you know that a fig isn't actually a single fruit, 
                    it's a bunch of tiny flowers all growing inside a soft shell!
                </p>

                Look! A Monarch butterfly! Monarchs rest together in huge groups called roosts when they migrate. Maybe she's going to find a tree to cuddle up with the others!

                    Sometimes squirrels forget where they buried their nuts, and those nuts grow into new trees!
