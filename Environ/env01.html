        Hi, I'm Lila and welcome to my garden! Can you look over there? 
        I live in that fig tree. Did you know that a fig isn't actually a single fruit, 
        it's a bunch of tiny flowers all growing inside a soft shell!

         Look! A Monarch butterfly! Monarchs rest together in huge groups called roosts when they migrate. Maybe she's going to find a tree to cuddle up with the others!
